Implementations of simulated annealing, simple binary genetic algorithm and improved binary genetic algorithm.

Artifacts compiled using Java 17.

Jar file for each of the three algorithms can be found in out/artifacts/..

Run from the corresponding directory for each jar file:
```
java -jar AircrewSchedulingJava.jar [file number] [number of runs]
```

Where file number can be 1,2 or 3.
Where number of runs is the number of independent runs for each of the algorithm. Mean and standard deviations and graph will be produced after running all.
